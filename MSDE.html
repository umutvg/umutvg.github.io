 <b> 14:30-15:30</b> Cheuk Yu Mak (University of Southampton) - <em> Loop group action on symplectic cohomology </em>
  </summary>
  <p style="margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%" align="center">
    Abstract: For a compact Lie group G, its massless Coulomb branch algebra is the G-equivariant
Borel-Moore homology of its based loop space. This algebra is the same as the algebra of
regular functions on the BFM space. In this talk, we will explain how this algebra acts on the
equivariant symplectic cohomology of Hamiltonian G-manifolds when the symplectic manifolds
are open and convex. This is a generalization of the closed case where symplectic cohomology is
replaced with quantum cohomology. We also explain how it relates to the Coulomb branch
algebra of cotangent-type representations. This is joint work with Eduardo González and Dan
Pomerleano.

cohomology of a GIT quotient with the equivariant quantum cohomology via Fourier
transformation. I will also discuss examples of the conjecture and applications to decomposition
of quantum differential equations.</a>

  <b> 10:30-11:30</b>  Dan Pomerleano (UMass Boston) - <em> The quantum GIT conjecture </em> - online
  </summary>
  <p style="margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%" align="center">
    Abstract: Let X be a Fano variety with G action. The quantum GIT conjecture predicts a formula for the quantum cohomology of "anti-canonical" GIT quotients X//G in terms of the equivariant quantum cohomology of X. The formula is motivated by ideas from 3- dimensional gauge theory ("Coulomb branches") and provides a vast generalization of Batyrev's formula for the quantum cohomology of a toric Fano variety. I will explain the conjecture and then describe joint work in progress with C. Teleman towards proving it. The strategy of proof involves ideas from Varolgunes' theory of relative symplectic cohomology.

  <b> 14:30-15:30 </b> Matthew Habermann (University of Hamburg) - <em> On the symplectic cohomology for Milnor fibres of compound A_n singularities </em>
  </summary>
  <p style="margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%" align="center">
    Abstract: :  Compound du Val (cDV) singularities are the appropriate threefold generalisation of the classically studied du Val surface singularities. Unlike du Val singularities, however, there is no finite (ADE) list of cDV singularities, the singularities can have moduli, and they need not even be isolated. Another interesting algebro-geometric phenomenon which first appears in (complex) dimension three is the notion of a small resolution -- a resolution of singularities whose exceptional set has codimension greater than one.
Motivated by calculations which were made accessible by homological mirror symmetry, Lekili and Evans conjectured that the existence and behaviour of a small resolution of a given isolated cDV singularity should be witnessed by the symplectic cohomology of its Milnor fibre. In this talk, I will explain work-in-progress with Johan Asplund towards understanding the case of compound A_n singularities.

  <b> 15:45-16:45 </b> Yuto Yamamoto (IBS Center for Geometry and Physics) - <em> Period integrals of hypersurfaces via tropical geometry </em> - online
  </summary>
  <p style="margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%" align="center"> 
    Abstract: Abouzaid--Ganatra--Iritani--Sheridan computed asymptotics of integrations of holomorphic volume forms on toric Calabi--Yau hypersurfaces over Lagrangian sections of SYZ fibrations by using tropical geometry. They gave a new proof of the gamma conjecture for ambient line bundles on Batyrev pairs of mirror Calabi--Yau hypersurfaces. In the talk, we review their work and discuss its generalization to the case of toric hypersurfaces which are not necessarily Calabi--Yau hypersurfaces.
