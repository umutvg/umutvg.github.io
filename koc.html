<p style = "margin-left: 25px">
  Speaker: Daniele Agostini (University of Tübingen)<br>
  Title: Algebraic Geometry at Sea<br>
  Abstract: Smooth algebraic curves give rise to solutions to the KP equation, which models waves in shallow water, via Riemann’s theta function. Singular curves produce solutions as well, but the theta function in this case becomes degenerate. I will give an introduction to this circle of ideas and present some theoretical and computational results on this topic, based on both smooth and singular curves.

  Title: Hybrid: Symbolic-Numeric Computation<br>
  Abstract: There are two types of computation: symbolic computation and numerical computation. 
Symbolic (algebraic) computation manipulates symbols (which may or may not contain numbers) to eliminate the error in the computation. Numerical computation involves the use of approximations and is inevitably subject to error. The tools are usually derived from analysis. 
In this talk we will start with defining and comparing these two types of approaches. Then we will demonstrate how they can be used together. In particular, we will focus on the problem of polynomial root certification. Some symbolic (algebraic) methods can provide certification of the roots of polynomial systems; those roots can be computed very efficiently using numerical methods.

  Speaker: Ezgi Kantarcı Oğuz (Galatasaray University)<br>
  Title: Oriented Posets and Rank Matrices<br>
  Abstract: Fence posets are combinatorial objects that come up in a 
variety of settings, including cluster algebras, quiver 
representations, snake graphs and continued fractions. We will show 
that the rank polynomials corresponding to these posets are unimodal, 
proving a conjecture by Ovsienko and Morier-Genoud. We will introduce 
the more generalized framework of oriented posets where rank 
polynomials are replaced with rank matrices, and show applications in 
cluster algebras and polytopes. Partially based on joint work with Cem 
Yalım Özel, Mohan Ravichandran and Emine Yıldırım.

  <p style = "margin-left: 25px">
  Speaker: Barış Coşkunüzer (University of Texas at Dallas)<br>
  Title: Topological Machine Learning and Applications in Drug Discovery and Histopathology<br>  
  Abstract:  In this talk, we'll introduce fundamental techniques in topological machine learning and showcase their application in two specific contexts. The first application is on computer-aided drug discovery, utilizing Multiparameter Persistence for graph representation learning. Our second application revolves around cancer detection from histopathological images via cubical persistence. We apply our methodologies across five distinct cancer types, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art deep learning methods. The talk is accessible to graduate students in science and engineering, assuming no prior background in either topology or machine learning.

</h4>
</p>

  <p style = "margin-left: 25px">
  Speaker: Varga Kalantarov (Koç University)<br>
    Title: Some open problems in nonlinear partial differential equations<br>
  Title:  The talk will be devoted to open problems concerning glonal behavior of solutions to the initial boundary value problems for Navier-Stokes equatons and related systems, the Kirchhoff equation, Kortweg-de Vries equation, nonlinear Klein-Gordon and nonlinear Schrödinger equation.
Some open problems in the theory of infinite-dimensional dynamical systems generated by nonlinear parabolic and damped nonlinear wave equations will be also discussed.
