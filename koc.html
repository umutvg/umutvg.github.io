  Title: Energy based modeling, simulation and control of energy systems<br>
  Abstract: Most real world dynamical systems consist of subsystems from different physical domains, modelled by partial-differential equations, ordinary differential equations, and algebraic equations, combined with input and output connections. To deal with such complex system, in recent years energy based modeling via the class of dissipative port-Hamiltonian (pH) descriptor systems has emerged as a very successful mathematical modeling methodology. The main reasons are that the network based interconnection of pH systems is again pH, Galerkin projection in PDE discretization and model reduction preserve the pH structure and the physical properties are encoded in the geometric properties of the flow as well as the algebraic properties of the equations. Furthermore, dissipative pH systems form a very robust representation under structured perturbations and directly indicate Lyapunov functions for stability analysis. Another advantage of energy based modeling via pH systems is that each separate model of a physical system can  be a whole model catalog from which models can be chosen in an adaptive way within simulation and optimization methods. We discuss the model class of constrained pH systems and show how many classical real world mathematical models in energy systems can be formulated in this class. We illustrate the results with some real world examples from gas transport,  district heating and power systems and point out emerging mathematical challenges.

  Title: Hypocoercivity, hypocontractivity and short-time decay of solutions to linear evolution equations<br>
  Abstract: For linear evolution equations (in continuous-time and discrete-time) we revisit and extend the concepts of hypocoercivity and hypocontractivity and give a detailed analysis of the relations of these concepts to (asymptotic) stability, as well as (semi-)dissipativity and (semi-)contractivity, respectively. On the basis of these results, the short-time decay behavior of the norm of the fundamental solution matrix for linear continuous-time and discrete-time systems is characterized by an integer called hypocoercivity index or hypocontractivity index, respectively. The results extend to linear operators in Hilbert spaces and can be applied to the analysis of anisotropic flows.

  Speaker: Dimitrios Papathanasiou  (Sabancı University)<br>
  Title: Backward shift operators in Linear Dynamics<br>
  Abstract: Weighted backward shifts are among the most important classes of operators. Their dynamic behaviour has been well understood since the work of Salas. The need for creating more sophisticated examples of operators yet preserving some of the nice properties of weighted backward shifts has motivated the researchers to generalise the notion of a backward shift in several different directions. In the present talk, we will introduce weighted shifts on trees, weighted shifts on graphs, as well as an abstraction of those which we call generalized shifts. We will try to indicate the common properties enjoyed by all those shifts and mention some of their differences. The talk will be based on joint works with Karl Grosse-Erdmann, Quentin Menet, Anton Baranov and Andrei Lishanskii.

  Title: A construction of Mixed Tate Nori Motives<br>
  Abstract: Grothendieck proposed the category of motives as a Tannakian category, offering a universal framework for Weil cohomology theories. In this talk, we will consider motives in the sense of Nori. Beilinson conjectured that the Hopf algebra R of mixed Tate motives is isomorphic to the bi-algebra A of Aomoto polylogarithms. Our aim is to reconstruct A using limits of Nori motives coming from some special configurations. This allows us to write a morphism from A to R and gives a new approach to Beilinson's conjecture.

  Title: Functorial equivalence classes of blocks of finite groups<br>
  Abstract: Let k be an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic p > 0 and let F be an
algebraically closed field of characteristic 0. In 2022, together with Bouc, we introduced
the notion of functorial equivalence of blocks and proved the following finiteness theorem
in the spirit of Puig’s finiteness conjecture: Given a p-group D, there are only finitely
many pairs (G, b) of a finite group G and a block b of kG with defect groups isomorphic to
D, up to functorial equivalence over F. In this talk, we classify the functorial equivalence
classes of blocks of finite and tame representation types. In particular, we prove that for
all these blocks, the functorial equivalence classes depend only on the fusion system of
the block. Some parts of this work are joint with Boltje and Bouc.

  Title: Density questions on elliptic curves<br>
  Abstract: In number theory, there are many important questions that have been withstanding
our attempts to answer them. While a complete answer to these questions may seem out of reach
in the near future, certain conjectural answers are widely believed due to significant theoretical and
numerical evidence. Arithmetic statistics provides a plausible approach to test these conjectures.
In this talk, we plan to overview some of the results offered by arithmetic statistics in the direction
of elliptic curves.

  Title: Re-assessing thermal response of schistosomiasis transmission risk: evidence for a higher thermal optimum than previously predicted<br>
  Abstract: The geographical distribution of parasitic disease schistosomiasis is influenced by the ecology of both schistosome parasites and their obligatory host snails, which are responsive to temperature variations. Previous models found thermal optimum for the transmission of schistosomiasis at 21.7°C, a figure incongruent with the temperatures found in high endemic regions. To address this, we developed nonlinear thermal response model of schistosomiasis whose parameters are function of temperature describing the physiological and epidemiological aspects of S. mansoni and S. haematobium, as well as their host snails Biomphalaria spp. and Bulinus spp. respectively. We then reformulated the basic reproduction number and the prevalence of schistosome infection as functions of temperature. Our analysis revealed that the optimal temperature range for the transmission of S. mansoni and S. haematobium falls between 23.1-27.3°C and 23.6-27.9°C respectively (with a 95% confidence interval). Additionally, we observed a shift towards higher temperatures in the optimal range as human water contact rates increase with temperature. These findings are consistent with extensive datasets on schistosomiasis prevalence in Sub-Saharan Africa. Our refined nonlinear thermal-response model suggests that many regions suitable for schistosomiasis transmission, particularly those with mean annual temperatures below the thermal optimum, may experience increased risk of transmission with future warming.

  Title: A Quantum Inspired Bi-level Optimization Algorithm for the First Responder Network Design Problem<br>
  Abstract: In the aftermath of a sudden catastrophe, First Responders (FR) strive to promptly reach and rescue immobile victims. Simultaneously, other mobile individuals take roads to evacuate the affected region, access medical facilities or shelters, or reunite with their relatives. The escalated traffic congestion significantly hinders critical FR operations if they share some of the same roads. A proposal from the Turkish Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure being discussed for implementation is to allocate a subset of road segments for use by FRs only, mark them clearly, and pre-communicate them to the citizens. For the FR paths under consideration: (i) there should exist an FR path from designated entry points to each demand point in the network, and (ii) evacuees try to leave the network (through some exit points following the selfish routing principle) in the shortest time possible when they know that certain segments are not available to them. We develop a mixed integer non-linear programming formulation for this First Responder Network Design Problem (FRNDP). We solve FRNDP using a novel hybrid quantum-classical heuristic building on the Graver Augmented Multi-Seed Algorithm (GAMA). Using the flow-balance constraints for the FR and evacuee paths, we use a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model to obtain a partial Graver Bases to move between the feasible solutions of FRNDP. To efficiently explore the solution space for high-quality solutions, we develop a novel bi-level nested GAMA within GAMA: GAGA. We test GAGA on random graph instances of various sizes and instances related to an expected Istanbul earthquake. Comparing GAGA against a state-of-the-art exact algorithm for traditional formulations, we find that GAGA offers a promising alternative approach. We hope our work encourages further study of quantum (inspired) algorithms to tackle complex optimization models from other application domains.

  Title: Algebraic Geometry at Sea<br>
  Abstract: Smooth algebraic curves give rise to solutions to the KP equation, which models waves in shallow water, via Riemann’s theta function. Singular curves produce solutions as well, but the theta function in this case becomes degenerate. I will give an introduction to this circle of ideas and present some theoretical and computational results on this topic, based on both smooth and singular curves.

  Speaker: Tülay Ayyıldız (Gebze Teknik Üniversitesi)<br>
  Title: Hybrid: Symbolic-Numeric Computation<br>
  Abstract: There are two types of computation: symbolic computation and numerical computation. 
Symbolic (algebraic) computation manipulates symbols (which may or may not contain numbers) to eliminate the error in the computation. Numerical computation involves the use of approximations and is inevitably subject to error. The tools are usually derived from analysis. 
In this talk we will start with defining and comparing these two types of approaches. Then we will demonstrate how they can be used together. In particular, we will focus on the problem of polynomial root certification. Some symbolic (algebraic) methods can provide certification of the roots of polynomial systems; those roots can be computed very efficiently using numerical methods.

  Title: Oriented Posets and Rank Matrices<br>
  Abstract: Fence posets are combinatorial objects that come up in a 
variety of settings, including cluster algebras, quiver 
representations, snake graphs and continued fractions. We will show 
that the rank polynomials corresponding to these posets are unimodal, 
proving a conjecture by Ovsienko and Morier-Genoud. We will introduce 
the more generalized framework of oriented posets where rank 
polynomials are replaced with rank matrices, and show applications in 
cluster algebras and polytopes. Partially based on joint work with Cem 
Yalım Özel, Mohan Ravichandran and Emine Yıldırım.

  Title: Topological Machine Learning and Applications in Drug Discovery and Histopathology<br>  
  Abstract:  In this talk, we'll introduce fundamental techniques in topological machine learning and showcase their application in two specific contexts. The first application is on computer-aided drug discovery, utilizing Multiparameter Persistence for graph representation learning. Our second application revolves around cancer detection from histopathological images via cubical persistence. We apply our methodologies across five distinct cancer types, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art deep learning methods. The talk is accessible to graduate students in science and engineering, assuming no prior background in either topology or machine learning.

    Title: A journey into the world of p-adic heights <br>
  Abstract: In Diophantine geometry, height functions measure the “size” of rational points on algebraic varieties. Such functions play a central role in defining and computing several interesting invariants in arithmetic geometry. A p-adic height function can be regarded as a “local” analogue of a classical height function, where p is a prime number, and there are several p-adic height functions in the literature. In this talk, we will journey into the world of p-adic heights. In particular, we will discuss the relationships among different p-adic heights and algorithms to compute them numerically.

    Title: A Morse-Bott approach to the equivariant homotopy type<br>
   Abstract: Morse theory provides an effective way to calculate the homology of smooth manifolds, in terms of critical points of a function and its gradient flow. Floer applied this idea in the infinite dimensional setting to produce new invariants in symplectic and low dimensional topology, and motivated by this, Cohen, Jones and Segal has shown how to obtain finer information about the topology of a smooth manifold from the Morse theory, thus providing a framework for refining Floer's invariant too. However, neither Morse theory nor the framework of Cohen-Jones-Segal are compatible with the compact group actions on the underlying manifold. In this talk, I will explain how to define a new framework for Morse-Bott functions in order to extract information about the equivariant stable homotopy type. In the remaining time, I will discuss applications to equivariant Floer theory. Joint work with Laurent Cote.

  Abstract:  We explain how to extend the definition of the superpotential and wrapped Fukaya category from closed embedded Lagrangians to Lagrangians with conical singularities, by relying on techniques from Symplectic Field Theory. In particular we introduce the refined potential as defined in joint work with T. Ekholm and D. Tonkonog. We apply this technique to the singular Lagrangian skeleton given as the complement of z_1z_2...z_n=1 in C^n, which can be considered as a monotone singular Lagrangian inside CPn.

    Title:  Extremal triangle-free graphs<br>
  Abstract:  In this talk, we will address an extremal problem from two perspectives: structural graph theory
and Integer Programming (IP). We will determine the maximum number of edges in a triangle-free
graph when its maximum degree is at most d and its matching number is at most m for two given
integers d and m. We will derive structural properties of extremal triangle-free graphs, which will
allow us i) to provide a formula for this maximum number which is valid in most cases, ii) to develop
an IP formulation for constructing extremal graphs, which has surprising links with the classical
Knapsack problem. We conjecture that our formula giving the size of extremal triangle-free graphs
is also valid for all the open cases and endorse this conjecture by solving the IP formulation for
some additional cases.
