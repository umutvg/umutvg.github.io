The goal of these 1-day events is to foster communication and collaboration
between mathematicians and theoretical physicists. Meetings will
take place on <b>Friday's</b> at <a href="http://fezagursey.boun.edu.tr/ ">Feza Gürsey Center for Physics and 
Mathematics</a> which is located in the <b>Kandilli campus of Boğaziçi University</b>. For
transportation and other practical information please check <a href="http://fezagursey.boun.edu.tr/?sayfa=18">here</a>. There will be <b>two sessions</b> in each event. The
morning session <b>10:30-12:00</b> will be elementary and will give a basic introduction to the subject. It will be followed by an afternoon session <b>13:30-15:00</b>, which will be a continuation towards more advanced aspects.

   <b> 10.03.2023 </b> - Tekin Dereli (Maltepe University and Koç University) - <em> Where Does Simple Supergravity Theory

Stand Today? </em>
  </summary>
  <p style="margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%" align="center">
    Abstract: N=1 supergravity theory in d=4 dimensions is the simplest locally
supersymmetric extension of Einstein's general theory of relativity. A
short overview of its many remarkable properties will be given. In
particular I will introduce the notion of complex quaternionic exterior
differential forms and discuss their relevance for simple supergravity.

  </summary>
  <p style="margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%" align="center">
    Abstract: The spectral properties of natural self-adjoint operators 
such as the Hodge Laplacian and the Dirac operator play a fundamental 
role in understanding many geometric and physical problems. I will 
discuss some aspects of the theory in the very rich context of closed 
hyperbolic three-manifolds, and highlight connections with geometry, 
low-dimensional topology, and number theory.

   <b> 07.04.2023 </b> - Jan Rosseel (Boskovic Institute, Zagreb) - <em> Non-Lorentzian Geometry </em>
  </summary>
  <p style="margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%" align="center">
    Abstract: Non-Lorentzian geometry refers to a differential geometric framework for
space-times with a degenerate metric structure and a local causal structure
that differs from the one of Lorentzian geometry. It has recently found new
applications, e.g., in the study of field and gravitational theories in
non- and ultra-relativistic regimes. In the first of these two lectures, I
will provide an introduction to non-Lorentzian geometry, focusing on the
examples of Galilean and Newton-Cartan geometry that describe
non-relativistic space-times. I will discuss their metric structure and
metric-compatible affine connections with and without torsion in a frame
formulation. I will furthermore comment on the physical interpretation of
these structures and outline differences with Lorentzian geometry.

The second lecture will focus on the appearance of non-Lorentzian geometry
in non-relativistic string theory, a consistent and UV-complete string
theory whose excitations exhibit non-relativistic dispersion relations and
Newtonian gravitational interactions. After an introduction to
non-relativistic string theory, I will argue that its target space-time
geometry is given by an extension of Newton-Cartan geometry, called string
Newton-Cartan geometry. I will discuss the structure of string
Newton-Cartan geometry and show how it can be viewed as a particular limit
of Lorentzian geometry equipped with an extra two-form Kalb-Ramond gauge
field. If time permits, I will outline how this limit can be used to obtain
effective gravitational field equations for non-relativistic string theory
and comment on T-duality in non-relativistic string theory.

   <b> 14.04.2023 </b> - Ivan Cheltsov (University of Edinburgh) - <em> K-moduli of Fano threefolds in the family 3-10 </em>
  </summary>
  <p style="margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%" align="center">
    Abstract: Smooth Fano 3-folds are classified in 105 families (Iskovskikh, Mori, Mukai). For the description of these families, see <a href="https://www.fanography.info">https://www.fanography.info </a>. We know which deformation families have K-polystable (Kahler-Einstein) members and which do not
(Araujo, Castravet, Cheltsov, Fujita, Kaloghiros, Martinez-Garcia, Shramov, Suess, Viswanathan). Since K-polystable Fano threefolds form good moduli spaces, it would be interesting to describe K-moduli of smoothable Fano 3-folds (moduli that parametrize K-polystable smooth members of a given deformation family and their K-polystable limits). This is a very active area of research, but the problem has only been solved for the following 52 deformation families: zero-dimensional families (47 families), two one-dimensional families (families 2-24 and 2-25), cubic 3-folds (Liu, Xu), complete intersection of two quadrics (Spotti, Sun), quartic double solids (Ascher, DeVleming, Liu). In this talk, I will speak about K-moduli of Fano 3-folds in the family 3-10, see <a href=" https://www.fanography.info/3-10">https://www.fanography.info/3-10 </a>. This is a two-dimensional family whose smooth members can be obtained by blowing up a smooth quadric 3-fold along two disjoint conics. We know that a general member of this family is K-stable (Kahler-Einstein and finite automorphism groups), but some smooth members are not K-polystable (not Kahler-Einstein), and some members have infinite automorphism group (Cheltsov, Przyjalkowski, Shramov). In the talk, I will give explicit classification of all smooth members of the family 3-10 (normal forms), explain which smooth Fano 3-folds in this family are K-polystable and which are not (Araujo, Castravet, Cheltsov, Fujita, Kaloghiros, Martinez-Garcia, Shramov, Suess, Viswanathan), and describe all singular K-polystable members of this family (work in progress with Alan Thompson from Loughborough). If time permits, I will explain how to prove K-polystability of one singular and very symmetric member of this deformation family.

   <b> 28.04.2023 </b> - Gleb Arutyunov (II. Institute for Theoretical Physics, 
Hamburg University) - <em> Geometric construction of integrable models </em>
  </summary>
 <p style="margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%" align="center">
    Abstract:In the first lecture I will present the geometric construction of a 
wide class of integrable many-body systems
by using the Hamiltonian and Poisson reduction techniques. I will 
demonstrate that in some cases
the corresponding reduction scheme pertains to quantisation where it shows up
as a special factorisation problem in quantum algebras.

In the second lecture I will discuss an advanced application of the 
reduction technique to the construction of
the hyperbolic Ruijsenaars-Schneider model with spin. I will show that 
the model enjoys the Poisson-Lie symmetry
which explains its superintegrability. For the quantum model without 
spin I will present the L-operator algebra
and integrals of motion in the formalism of the quantum inverse 
scattering method.

   <b> 12.05.2023 </b> - Hermann Nicolai (Max-Planck-Institut für Gravitationsphysik, Albert-Einstein-Institut) - <em> Recent Developments in Supermembrane Theory</em>
  </summary>
  <p style="margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%" align="center">
    Abstract: The (unique) maximally extended D=11 supermembrane theory
stands out as a candidate for the non-perturbative unification of
superstring theory. In this talk I will review some basic features,
in particular the light-cone gauge reformulation of the theory as the
N-->∞ limit of the maximally supersymmetric SU(N) matrix model,
and present new evidence for the existence of the N-->∞ limit,
using a path integral formulation. I will also touch on several open
issues, such as the construction of supermembrane vertex
operators.
