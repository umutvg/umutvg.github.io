    Abstract: There are 105 irreducible families of smooth Fano threefolds,
which have been classified by Iskovskikh, Mori and Mukai. For each
family,
we determine whether its general member admits a Kaehler-Einstein metric
or not.

   Grigory Mikhalkin (University of Geneva) - <em> Tropical correspondence broken by Lagrangian tori </em>
  </summary>
  <p style="margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%" align="center"> 
    Abstract: We present a new version of tropical-to-complex correspondence theorem. Given a regular tropical curve C in R^N passing through a collection of points P, we realize each component of C-P by a compact holomorphic curve with smooth boundary on the corresponding fiber tori in C*^N. In other words, the holomorphic curve is cut to individual pieces whose amoebas have pinching points at P. The regularity condition holds automatically if N=2, and the curve is immersed. This version of the tropical correspondence theorem is motivated by a question of Cheuk Yu Mak and Ilia Zharkov.

   Susumu Tanabe (Galatasaray University) - <em> Period integrals associated to an invertible polynomial </em>
  </summary>
  <p style="margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%" align="center">
    Abstract: A non-degenerate square matrix with positive integer entries defines an invertible polynomial – a polynomial with as many terms as the number of variables. To study the monodromy of a hypersurface defined by an invertible polynomial, we propose to consider its dehomogenization through torus action so that it become Delsarte polynomial. We will be concerned with a generalized version of Dubrovin’s conjecture on the Stokes matrix associated to the Delsarte polynomial. 

Firstly, we remark the equivalence between oscillating integral for Delsarte polynomial (Landau-Ginzburg model) and quantum cohomology of a weighted projective space P. Secondly,we verify a correspondence between the Stokes matrix of oscillating integral and the Gram matrix of the full exceptional collection on P. By means of the Laplace transform, the oscillating integral turns out a period integral of the Delsarte polynomial hypersurface that can be understood as Pochhammer hypergeometric function. We apply the theory of hypergeometric functions to calculate the monodromy of the period integrals then the Stokes matrix of their inverse Laplace transform.

   Burak Özbağcı (Koç University) - <em> Rational blowdown graphs for symplectic fillings of lens spaces </em>
  </summary>
  <p style="margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%" align="center">
    Abstract: In a previous work with M.Bhupal, we proved that each minimal symplectic filling of any oriented lens

space, viewed as the singularity link of some cyclic quotient singularity and equipped with its canonical

contact structure, can be obtained from the minimal resolution of the singularity by a sequence of

symplectic rational blowdowns along linear plumbing graphs. Here we give a dramatically simpler

visual presentation of our rational blowdown algorithm in terms of the triangulations of a convex

polygon. As a consequence, we are able to organize the symplectic deformation equivalence classes of

all minimal symplectic fillings of any given lens space equipped with its canonical contact structure,

as a graded, directed, rooted, and connected graph, where the root is the minimal resolution of the

corresponding cyclic quotient singularity and each directed edge is a symplectic rational blowdown

along an explicit linear plumbing graph. Moreover, we provide an upper bound for the rational

blowdown depth of each minimal symplectic filling. (This is a joint work with M. Bhupal)

   Sergey Finashin (METU) - <em> On wall-crossing invariance of certain sums of Welschinger numbers </em>
  </summary>
  <p style="margin-left: 30%; margin-right: 30%" align="center">
    Abstract: (joint work with Kharlamov)
We present real enumerative invariants not sensitive to changing the 
real structure on del Pezzo surfaces
of degrees 1,2 and 3.
These invariants are obtained by signed summation of Welschinger 
invariants for a fixed anticanonical degree.
The signs come from certain canonical Pin-structures on the real loci 
of these surfaces.
