<big>Cohomology of manifolds</big><br>
</h1>

<p>
In this course we will discuss singular cohomology, focusing on the case of topological manifolds, deRham cohomology of smooth manifolds, and the comparison between the two that goes by the name of deRham's Theorem.<br>
Below is some preliminary information about the course, more will be posted in February. 
</p>
  
  <p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Course plan
<br>
</span>The course will consist of three parts:
<br> - Part I: Singular cohomology (4 weeks)
<br> We will focus on the case of topological manifolds. We will definitely cover Poincare duality, cup product and Mayer-Vietoris sequence. I will also briefly mention the axiomatic characterization of singular (co)homology.
<br> - Part II: Differential forms and deRham cohomology (4 weeks)
<br> We will start with the basics of differential forms on smooth manifolds and then discuss Stokes theorem and the homotopy formula. We will then define the deRham complex and discuss analogs of properties from Part I. I will briefly discuss Thom forms and intersection theory for submanifolds.
<br>  -Part III: Comparison (2 weeks)
<br> We will prove that on a smooth manifold deRham cohomology is isomorphic to singular cohomology. I will very briefly mention other ways of getting at the cohomology of a smooth manifold using Morse and sheaf theories.

    <p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Preliminary reading
<br>
</span> - Fundamental group of a topological space. We will not cover this very important notion in the course, which would typically be covered before homology/cohomology in an introductory algebraic topology course. It is very important that you learn it yourself. This will be a good preparation for the first part of the course as well.
  <br>    - Definitions of topological and smooth manifolds. We will cover these in the course, but you might want to do some reading by yourself. You can read <a href="historyofmanifold.pdf">this</a> historical account for example.
   <br> - Exterior algebra of a finite dimensional vector space. The linear algebra that is used in the theory of differential forms can feel a bit quick, so you might want to just start thinking about it by reading this from Wikipedia etc.
   <br> - <a href="samelson_forms_history.pdf">Here</a> is also a historical account for differential forms.
  <br>
<br>  On reading historical accounts: these are generally quite difficult to understand, but for a good reason. I advise you to suffer through them as much as you can.    
      
         <p>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Notes
<br>
</span> - There will be weekly homework assigned. Working on them will be essential for keeping up with the course. All of them will be due at the end of the semester - you can keep updating them. You will be able to work on them together with your peers and there will also be office hours.
  <br>    - There will be an oral exam at the end, where I will ask you reproduce some of the homework solutions that you submitted.
   <br> - I will post lecture notes.
   <br> - The plan  is a bit ambitious. I will try to get through all of it, so it will be quick. Some of the proofs will be relegated to homework or entirely omitted. I will prioritize giving intuition over perfect rigor.
